This blog will be here to cover my journey and also to document events, conferences, new projects or job opportunities I might encounter.

## How I set up my blog

It was a long journey to get there but I just wanted a way to add a markdown file and have it rendered as a blog post, simple as that.

I took the decision to just ask v0 to help out but then I took over as it missed some things. But what I like is that I just scan anything in `/data/blogs` and then can render these as seperate blog cards,
I used `matter` to parse the frontmatter and then render the content using `MDXProvider` and `MDXRemote` to render the content.

referred to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/extending-mdx) and [Next.js | MDX](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/mdx) documentation to get this working.

Using some plugins to format codeblocks and tables in the end it looks somewhat like this:
```tsx
 <article className="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
    <MDXRemote source={post.content} options={{
        mdxOptions: {
            remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
            rehypePlugins: [[rehypePrettyCode, options], rehypeMdxCodeProps],
        },
    }}/>
</article>
```

with my options being:
```tsx
const options: Options = {
    theme: "github-dark",
    defaultLang: 'txt',
};
```

Pretty simple, but moving forward I'll try to put in the language and a copy button to copy the code block.
